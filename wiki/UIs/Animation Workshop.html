<h1>Animation Workshop</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    Animation Workshop is used from the user in order to create new animations 
    based on films that are installed in Animation Manager (see Animation Manager tab for more details). 
</p>

<br>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The user clicks to open the tab then all the installed films 
            have a visual representation through a box on the screen. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The user picks one film that will be played on the animation. (by clicking on the corresponding box)
        </li>
        <li>
            When picked a popup window will come on the screen and will provide some information to the user.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A panel that shows each individual frame of the film.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A panel that shows a live representation of how the animation will look like when created.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A panel to configure the animation delay, dx, dy, and id (name)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            When created, the animation will be available to be used by the user through code.
        </li>
    </ol>

<p>
    The ability for the user to change the frames of the film by manipulating the sequence, edit the frames, duplicating.
