            hudToggle: Every element that has class="hudChild" will be automatically hidden from the user

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
    When the UI is first loaded it hooks some function to some variables on the blackboard of the system. 
    That means, that every time this variable changes value the callback is being triggered. 
    Having this mechanism enables the system to be more interactive for example when a user clicks on an object 
    The value on blackboard-> state -> focusedObject is changed and the callback to re-render all the appropriate elements fires. 
    The same happens with the fps (blackboard -> state -> FPS).
