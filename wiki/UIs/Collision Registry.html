<h1>Collision Registry</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    Collision Registry is a tab where the user is able to register a new collision between to objects.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
    When the collision registry button is pressed there is a UI revealed that shows all the current 
    registered collision between objects. 
    And there is a box where a user can create a new collision between two objects. 
    Afterwards, the user is able to code the behavior on collision object (as an event).
</p>

<br>
<h3>Future Plans:</h3>
<p>
    When the Collision Manager (check collision manager tab) is expanded with surface the UI will be expanded to serve this feature.
