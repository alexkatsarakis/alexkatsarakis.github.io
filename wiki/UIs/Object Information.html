<h1>Object Information</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    Object Information shows all the currently available information for an object, 
    at the same time it enables the user to add/change or remove values accordingly.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
    When a new object is being focused the UI is responsible to re-render the information about the new object. 
    It shows:
    <ol>
        <li>States</li>
        <li>Attributes</li>
        <li>Events</li>
        <li>Flags</li>
    </ol> 
    On each of the above categories the user is able to add/change/remove a value. 
    The UI is using the provided API (check Architecture tab for more info) in order to be able to do 
    actions like add / change / remove. 
    Also, it is using flags and other Engine Managers in order to add extra functionality if available. 
    (e.g. copy object, save snapshot, delete object, etc.)
