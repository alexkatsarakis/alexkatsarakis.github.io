<h1>UI Manager Architecture</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    UI Manager is a crucial part of the system. 
    It is the outer most layer of the Macro-Architecture (as shown on Macro-Architecture tab) 
    and it is the UI that the end user will interact the most. 
    It is important to mention that, all the other sub-systems (Engine, Engine Extension, Actions) are 
    completely independent and unaware of the UI sub-system. This gives us the ability to create UIs that are 
    both functional and aesthetically pleasing for the end user.
</p>

<br>
<h3>The AddOn mechanisms:</h3>
<p>
    Since, we established that the UIs are only interacting with the system through the provided API 
    that means, that we can add as many UIs we want without "polluting" our base code.
</p>

<br>
<h3>API provided:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        installUI(args): Installs a UI to the Manager and will be a part of the system from now on.
    </li>
    <li>
        removeUI(name): Removes a UI from the Manager.
    </li>
    <li>
        loadUI(name): Load an installed UI and from now on it will be visible.
    </li>
    <li>
        hideUI(name): Hides a UI and now it won't be visible from the user.
    </li>
    <li>
        getUIs(): Returns an array of all the UIs installed at the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        getLoadedUIs(): Returns an array of all the loaded UIs currently on the system.
    </li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Dynamically install,load,hide,remove UIs during the game play.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create dynamic UIs using it's own HTML5,CSS,JS with the provided API to interact with the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create Game Objects with HTML5,CSS,JS that will get intergrated to the game when the UI is installed for the first time.
        This enable the AddOn developers to do very high level UI functionality like adding videos, other web pages and other features to the game.
    </li>
</ol>
<br>

<h3>How do I add an AddOn?</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Within the UI folder of the system you create a folder with the name of the UI you want.
    </li>
    <li>
        You create a Javascript file with the same name within that folder.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Javascript must export the followings.
        <br>
        <code>
            export default {<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;name:'{the name of the UI}',<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;link: './src/UI/{folder}/{htmlFile}.html',<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;cb: onLoadCallback,<br>
                &emsp;&emsp;removable: true, // if the can be removed after installation <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;loadOnInstall: true // if we want to load the UI right away<br>
            };<br>
        </code>
    </li>
    <li>
        To use the API import Engine and follow each API you want (check the appropriate Manager tab)
    </li>
    <li>
        To use the blackboard import blackboard and check what things are installed at the moment.
    </li>
</ol>
