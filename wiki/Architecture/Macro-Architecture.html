<h1>Macro-Architecture</h1>

<p>
    In order to understand the Macro-Architecture of the application we must first 
    see the main components of the system.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Utilities
    </li>
    <li>
        Database
    </li>
    <li>
        Assets
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Ma-Arch-Engine">Engine</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Ma-Arch-Engine-Extension">Engine Extension</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Ma-Arch-Engine-API">Engine API</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Ma-Arch-Actions">Actions</a>
        
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Ma-Arch-UIs">User Interfaces</a>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The connection between those is shown below:

<p>
    For now, let's skip Utilities, Database and Assets.
</p>

<br>
<h3 id="Ma-Arch-Engine">Engine</h3>
<p>
    The Engine is the most important part of our system (check Engine tab for more details). 
</p>
<p>
    The idea is, that the Engine object is responsible for the life cycle of the app and at the same time it 
    is responsible to install all the Managers (check Managers tab) that are required.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, the Engine is a class that installs all the required managers for important tasks (such as time tracking, 
    animations, objects) and firing events each frame (input, render, AI, user code, etc).
</p>

<div id="Ma-Arch-img2" class="Ma-Arch-image"></div>

<br>
<h3 id="Ma-Arch-Engine-Extension">Engine Extension</h3>
<p>
    Of course, having a closed system, like the Engine isn't ideal since we want to be able 
    to expand our system later with features we haven't even thought. That's why we need 
    Engine Extension that will install extra Managers that aren't necessary for the system to operate.
</p>
<p>
    The idea behind Engine Extension is to have a mechanism responsible to install extra managers 
    that will eventually be part of the Engine in order to provide extra features.
</p>

<div id="Ma-Arch-img3" class="Ma-Arch-image"></div>

<p>
    Now, that we saw how the core of the system works and how it is getting composed from 
    different Managers we can finally take a step back and treat all the Engine (Engine, Engine Extension) 
    as a black box. 
</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Ma-Arch-Engine-API">Engine API</h3>
<p>
    In order to help the developer, it is very helpful to keep some things as black boxes even within 
    the same system. That's why, isolating the Engine and being able to use it only by interacting with it's API 
    is so important.
</p>
<p>
    The engine API is the accumulation of all the individual APIs provided by the Managers as shown below.
</p>

<div id="Ma-Arch-img4" class="Ma-Arch-image"></div>

<br>
<h3 id="Ma-Arch-Actions">Actions</h3>
<p>
    After the initialization of the Engine and the Engine Extension the API is now available, we are now able to use it. 
    We are taking advantage of the API by extending our systems capabilities even more. The first way to do it, is by providing small 
    but important functionality using the given API.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if our Engine has installed PauseManager that means (according to PauseManager's API) that 
    We are able to use some functions like stop, resume, etc. to create higher level functionality like 
    pauseAndOpenDialogBox that will open a dialog box after the pause. 
</p>
<p>
    The idea behind Actions, is that we are using the minimum functionality within the Engine in order to keep it 
    as simple as possible and it isn't poluted by complicated code that can be more focused (just like our example above)
</p>

<br>
<h3 id="Ma-Arch-UIs">User Interfaces</h3>
<p>
    Last but definatelly not least, is the User Interfaces (check User Interfaces Tab for more details). 
</p>
<p>
    UIs are able to use both Engine API and all the Actions that are created in order to provide the user with 
    useful and interactive UIs to help them use the system and make their UX (User Experience) much better.
</p>
<p>
    So how the UIManager works?
</p>
<p>
    UIManager is responsible to install all the UIs that each one consists of (JS,HTML,CSS,etc). 
    UIManager can remove, add, update each UI at any point of the run time.
