<h1>Timewarp Manager (Snapshot)</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    Timewarp manager is responsible about replaying/playback of a scene with the 
    ability to retrace your steps and continue from each point of the recording. 
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        startRecording(interval): Start recording and save frame each interval (0 for each frame).
    </li>
    <li>
        stopRecording(): Will pause the game and will give the ability to rewind/replay or even step to a point in the recordings.
    </li>
    <li>
        playForward(startingTimestamp, speedfactor = 1): Play each frame from the frame on the given timestamp until the end with the original delay 
        that the game had (except if you change speedfactor).
    </li>
    <li>
        playBackward(startingTimestamp, speedfactor = 1): Play each frame from the frame on the given timestamp until the first with the original delay 
        that the game had (except if you change speedfactor).
    </li>    
    <li>
        stopPlayback(): if there was a playback currently playing will stop showing the rest of the frames. 
    </li>
    <li>
        showSnapshot(timeStamp, frame): Display the frame on the given timeStamp on the screen. if frame is provided it will show the end user the frame that is currently showing. 
    </li>
    <li>
        getRecordedTimestamps(): returns an array with all the timestamps that the recording managed to collect.
    </li>    
    <li>
        resumeFromRecording(timeStamp): Display the frame on the given timeStamp and then resume the game and the animators so the user is able to continue the game from this point.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>How it works:</h3>
<p>
    When the manager get's a startRecording with a given interval the first frame after interval milliseconds 
    pass will take a Snapshot of the game state. That means that everything required to restore the game state 
    will be saved. Then, on stopRecording we will have a collection of snapshots that we are able to replay by showing 
    to the user (through showSnapshot function).
    <br>
    The showFunction is simple, checks if the objects are all alive, if not it makes adjustments.
    then it replaces the values that we had saved on the snapshot.
    <br>
    Another thing that this manager provides is the replay methods (playForward,playBackward). These methods,
    just says to the ClockManager to play a current frame on a given moment. So, if we play the snapshots with the correct 
    delay we give the user a nice playback experience. And if we want to stop the playback we can just remove all the callbacks 
    that we asked ClockManager to play.
