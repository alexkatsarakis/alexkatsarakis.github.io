<h1>Scripting Manager</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    Scripting Manager is responsible to manage any interaction that includes user code.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Info:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Path: {src}/Engine/scripting/scripting.js
    </li>
    <li>
        Exports: Class ScriptingManager()
    </li>
    <li>
        Responsible to initialize: Engine
    </li>
    <li>
        API access: Engine.ScriptingManager
    </li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>API Exported:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        currentScriptAsText(): Return the current script on editor as Text (whatever represantation the current editor wants as string).
    </li>
    <li>
        currentScriptAsCode(): Return the current script on editor as Code (Javascript code as string).
    </li>
    <li>
        executeCode(codes, currentObjectID): Executes the code saved from currentScript.
    </li>
    <li>
        clearAndLoadFromText(codes): Clear the editor and load the new text on editor.
    </li>
    <li>
        injectInDiv(div): Called from UI in order to notify that the scripting UI shall be added there.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>What languages are currently supported?</h3>
<p>
    Currently the system supports two languages. 
    The first is a visual programming language (Blockly) to help users with no programming experience to learn and experiment.
    The second is pure Javascript that will enable the user to type Javascript to code the game.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How can I add a new language?</h3>
<p>
    In order for someone to add a new language to the system the first requirement is to implement 
    the API that the ScriptingManager will call.
    <ul>
        <li>
            currentScriptAsText
        </li>
        <li>
            currentScriptAsCode
        </li>
        <li>
            executeCode
        </li>
        <li>
            clearAndLoadFromText
        </li>
        <li>
            injectInDiv
        </li>
    </ul>
    Also, a way to call the API provided by the system that has wrapped in Engine API, Actions (check Engine API and Actions tabs for more details).
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you wanted to add python as a supported language. You 'll need an interpreter to translate 
    python to Javascript and a way to represent the systems API to the language for example AK.createObject(...) 
    should be translated to AK.createObject(...) in Javascript.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How does ScriptingManager works?</h3>
<p>
    At the construction (that happens sometime on Engine construction) it will install all the supported languages 
    then only one currentEditor (This is for now, in future work it will supports cross language coding meaning you can add a script in Javascript and one Blockly at the same object)
    and then the manager is responsible to call the correct language in order to complete the request.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Why "codes"?</h3>
<p>
    Whenever an object saves a code it requires two things a text and a code the first is the representation on the editor 
    for example for blockly is XML but for pure Javascript it's Javascript. But, at the same time it requires the code so 
    the game can be run afterwards even if the editor isn't installed (also it's much faster than translating it) because 
    the code will always be in Javascript and can be evaluated.
