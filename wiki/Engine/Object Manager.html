<h1>Object Manager</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>
    Object Manager is responsible for keeping track of everything related to the objects. 
    First, it is able to save individual RenderManagers (check RenderManagers tab for more info) 
    that each one will provide their constructor for objects. Secondly, it will keep track of the 
    constructors available at any point. And third, it keeps track of all the objects alive.

<h3>API Exported:</h3>
<ol>
    Most frequent:
    <li>
        objects: Return an object that contains all the alive objects currently on the game.
    </li>
    <li>
        getObjectByID(objId): Return the object corresponding to this id if it's alive.
    </li>
    <li>
        getObjectByName(objName): Return the object corresponding to this name if it's alive
    </li>
    <br>
    Less frequent:
    <li>
        isSystemObject(objId): Return true/false if the object is listed as systemObject (like scene,collision,keyboard).
    </li>
    <li>
        addSystemObject(objId): From now on isSystemObject(objId) will return true for this id.
    </li>
    <li>
        renderAll(): Will render all the objects to the screen. (it's called by Engine each loop)
    </li>
    <li>
        addToWorld(newObject): Add newObject to the world. (usually called within the initialisation of the object itself)
    </li>
    <li>
        removeFromWorld(aliveObject): Removes aliveObject from the world. (usually called within the deconstruction of the object itself)
    </li>


    <li>
        addConstructor(name,constr): Installs a new constructor for objects. (installed by ObjectManager itself)
    </li>
    <li>
        removeConstructor(name): Removes an installed constructor from the manager
    </li>
    <li>
        getConstructor(name): Returns the constructor with that name.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>System Objects</h3>
<p>
    The Object Manager is responsible to instantiate these objects since these objects are not bound to any other manager. 
    More information can be found on System Object tab
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
    At the moment, there are two different RenderingManagers working at the same time. One is using the browser's element system and 
    the second one is using a custom made rendering system using canvas.
    So, when I install the First Manager all the constructors associated with it will come along and be installed to the system.
    From this point forward, the ObjectManager will be calling the render function of the manager each frame. 
    and each object created from a constructor that belong to that manager will have to be rendered.
