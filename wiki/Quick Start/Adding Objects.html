<h1>Adding Objects</h1>

<h3>What is an Object?</h3>
<p>
    An object is something that exist in the game and it can store values, interact 
    with other objects and run scripts accordingly.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How do I create an object?</h3>
<p>
    You can create an object either with code for more dynamic objects 
    (like bullets or short lived objects) or you can create it statically with UI. 
    To create an object that you will be able to manipulate just click "Create Object" 
    and then choose what category you want your object to be and a name.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How do I manipulate an object?</h3>
<p>
    In order to change value or to add a script you will just have to click on the object 
    (get this item in focus) and then some UIs will be created for that specific object. 
    On the left you will see some key points that you can add scripts and code to do certain 
    actions during the gameplay, and on the right you will see a panel that will show all the 
    values that the object currently has.
    <br> Through these UIs you will be able to do make the object to have interactivity with 
    the environment.
