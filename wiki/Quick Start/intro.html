<h3>General Idea:</h3>
<p>
    The general idea is simple, you create objects that exist in the game area and 
    you are able to add, change, remove variables in order to achieve your goal. 
    You are able to add scripts on most major events in order to have better control 
    of the behavior of the game you are building. With scripts that are fired you are 
    able to make objects interact with each other to create the feeling of the environment.

<h3>Starting:</h3>
<p>
    The feeling of an empty screen is very frightening to everyone. That's why the 
    first thing we should do is adding a color or an image as background. In order 
    to do that you have to click anywhere on the white screen and then the "Stage" 
    Object will be focused. You 'll then notice that upon focusing some UIs pop up. 
    On the right side of the screen is a panel that will enable you to change values 
    on each individual object. So to complete our first goal you just click on the edit 
    on Attributes -> background and on the input box you should wright "sky.jpeg" 
    or on the Attributes -> color you can write either hex in color or "red", "green", etc
