<h3>What is a script?</h3>
<p>
    A script is a small amount of commands that will be executed on a particular 
    time in order to achieve a goal.
</p>

<br>
<h3>Where do I need to add a script?</h3>
<p>
    Each object have different hook points that you are able to add a script 
    in order to achieve a certain goal. For example, you can add a script that 
    will fire when the game begin, another that will fire each time a value changes, etc.
    <br>Of course there are some special events that will be disguised on the appropriate tab.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How does the script interact with the game?</h3>
<p>
    Your code will interact with the game using the games API.<br>
    If you are using a Visual Programming Language then there will be blocks to guide 
    you how to structure the script in order to achieve the functionality.<br>
    If you are using a Text based language then you will need to read the API.
</p>

<br>
<h3>How shall the script look like?</h3>
<p>
    Here is an example of a script that will read the value "score" of the object 
    and it will increment it by one.<br>
