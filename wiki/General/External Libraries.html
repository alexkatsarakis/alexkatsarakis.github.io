<h1>External Libraries</h1>
<p>
    Since it's my Thesis work, and I am still learning I decided 
    to use the least amount of external libraries for my system. 
    I did that because I wanted to learn and practice on how to 
    code and manage a big project without the help of external libraries.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are things that were to complicated but necessery 
    for the project to be functional and that's why I chose some libraries to use.

<p>
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly">Blockly</a> is the main 
    visual programming language used for end users without experience in coding 
    in order to be able to play and create new things without the need to learn 
    the syntax or any API of the Engine.

<h3 id="Ext-Li-Matter">MatterJS</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">MatterJS</a> was used as the physics 
    engine for the system.

<h3 id="Ext-Li-Vue">VueJS</h3>
<p>
    <a href="https://vuejs.org/">VueJS</a> was used only on a single settings window 
    because I wanted to see if it was easy to add an external library for a 
    new developer on the system if someone wanted to expand the system with a new UI.
