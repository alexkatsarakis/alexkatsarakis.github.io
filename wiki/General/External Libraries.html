<h1>External Libraries</h1>
<p>
    Since it's my Thesis work, and I am still learning I decided 
    to use the least amount of external libraries for my system. 
    I did that because I wanted to learn and practice on how to 
    code and manage a big project without the help of external libraries.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, there are things that were to complicated but necessery 
    for the project to be functional and that's why I chose some libraries to use.
