<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>
    In our science, one of the biggest advantages is that we are able to 
    think about something and then be able to see it in action. This is a 
    very rewarding feeling that motivates us to keep working and learning.
    <br>
    That's why this project is trying to bridge this gap between an aspiring 
    beginners to learn and experiment. One way to achieve such feeling is by 
    giving them high "rewards" for their actions. By giving them the opportunity 
    to use Visual Programming Language with the help of another extra layer of 
    an easy to understand UI to manipulate objects and their behaviour.
</p>
<p>
    Since, creating a game is a very appealing idea for most beginners. Creating a 
    system that will help the users create and at the same time learn some 
    basic programming concepts is the ultimate goal.
</p>

<br>
<h3>What will the user learn?</h3>
<p>
    Our goal for the end user is to learn how to use basic programming concepts 
    while at the same time we are trying to teach him how to properly structure 
    a whole program.
    <br>
    Since, we are able to use a Visual Programming Language that means that a 
    beginner will be able to start creating without the need to learn how to code.
    <br>
    Also, having a live execution at any time enables the user to see and interact 
    with objects during "editing" and check the behaviour that a script or a changed 
    value will do.
    <br>
    Another innovation for system, is that we are trying to teach them the basics 
    Object Oriented Programming without the user being buffled with extra information. 
    In order to achieve that, we had to pair OOP concepts to the live game development. 
    And an experienced programmer will immidiatelly see the way it was managed. 
</p>

<br>
<h3>The extra mile</h3>
<p>
    Of course, since we built such a powerful system we would someone stop there?
    <br>
    There are a lot of levels of programming experience that the system can serve. 
    If we had to make a list of that "ladder" it would be.
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Visual Programming Game Development
        </li>
        <li>
            Text Programming Game Development
        </li>
        <li>
            AddOn Development
        </li>
        <li>
            Action Development
        </li>
        <li>
            Engine Development
        </li>
    </ol>
    Each layer adds another level of difficulty for a programmer. (To see how 
    you are able to do steps 3,4,5 check the corresponding tab)
