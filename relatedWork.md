## Goal

When you are creating, it's important to feel like you belong and you are a part of the world you are creating. This feeling is very important for someone to have but at the same time it's very difficult to achieve in many fields of science.
In Computer Science, we have the opportunity to achieve this in a way but for most cases in order to get to that level of expertise it requires a lot of years of experience and hard work.



## Implementation
1. It's important to split code in a way that it is readable and easy to understand for someone that doesn't have a lot of experience.
    - To tackle this problem we are trying to drive the user to write code in an "Object Oriented" way. The reason behind that is because that's the most common to the real world.
        - A lot of already established game editors for people that doesn't know how to code use this kind of storing and manipulate data/code [[1](#(1)Scratch)]
    - Another thing that we us programmers tend to utilize a lot is the reuse of already existing code. (functions, methods, etc).
        - On most editors [[1](#(1)Scratch)] the only way to achieve this is by utilizing functions
    



#### (1)Scratch
- Block definition (like functions)
- 1 code "space" per sprite
