-  = Title of TODO
-> = Explanation
=> = Problems I face 

IDE:

    - (Done) Extra UI to manipulate theme-colors!! and/or which UI built-in components I want to be able to see

    - add object preview for 454engine.

    - make the user able to change frame order on animation creation.


ENGINE:

    - (Done) Change all names to be IDs (objects, events, values, collisions, etc)

    - Add tickAnimator (!important)

    - Load manager

    - invoke functions through blackboard

    - Pause/start

    - Add states for objects

    - Create ScrollingManager and map coordinates from there.

    - (Done meh) CollisionManager
        => how am I going to show it? (pop up window for adding, lines between objects edit)
        => who owns the code? (CollisionManager)
        => how am Î™ going to handle collision with different objects? (different scripts)

    - Add Options (e.g. I want to be able to move things with my mouse while playing)

FEATURES:

    - introduce script information
        -> when a script is clicked it will automatically show:
                1) object that the script is binded to.
                2) objects that the script is refering.
                3) highlight objects affected by the script.

    - Code even more stuff
        -> transitionToState(X,code),transitionOutOfState(X,code)
           (dont on collisionmanager) onCollisionWith(X,code), 
           onAttributeChange(X,code),onAttributeRetrieval(X,code)
           onValueChange(X,code),onValueRetrieval(X,code)

    - introduce timelines
        -> a button that when clicked it will create a different "timeline" and it will show to user what will happen
           when the script is activated
        => how to prevent side-effects (e.g. object removal)
        => when is a timeline stopped? (problem when we have async calls like animations)

    - Logging system
        -> Log all actions done and show it to user in order to understand whats going on easier.

    - Integrated key binding feature (in settings).

    - Integrated menu system for user to END-user.
        -> pause the game
        -> change config (w/e coder use)
            -> key binding
            -> save
            -> sound
            -> etc
        -> resume game
        

Extra:

    - Add block for:
        -> distance

    - Starting Page includes
        -> What animation films to include
        -> Level of experience and start with different settings
        -> load saved/import projects


PROBABLY DISCARDED:

    - Scale canvas ctx
        => scaling must be done on obj values, renderer, physics engine (which creates dependency)
        => problem with picking and scaling is not intuitive to people
        
    - add unique IDs to everything instead of just names
        => this doesn't help on reload / sharing
