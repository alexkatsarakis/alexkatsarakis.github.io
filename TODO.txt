-  = Title of TODO
-> = Explanation
=> = Problems I face 


IDE:

    - (Done) Extra UI to manipulate theme-colors!! and/or which UI built-in components I want to be able to see

    - (Done) add object preview for 454engine.

    - make the user able to change frame order on animation creation.


ENGINE:

    - (Done) Change all names to be IDs (objects, events, values, collisions, etc)

    - (Done) Add tickAnimator (!important)

    - (Done) Load manager

    - (deprecated) invoke functions through blackboard

    - (Done) Pause/start

    - (Done) Add states for objects

    - Create ScrollingManager and map coordinates from there.

    - (Done meh) CollisionManager
        => how am I going to show it? (pop up window for adding, lines between objects edit)
        => who owns the code? (CollisionManager)
        => how am Î™ going to handle collision with different objects? (different scripts)

    - (Done) Add Options (e.g. I want to be able to move things with my mouse while playing)

FEATURES:

    - More Blocks
        -> Category: Distance // Between objects, from grid, from mouse
        -> Category: Quantizer // e.g. Move to {...} in {x} seconds
        -> Category: Mouse // click 
        -> Games state
        -> Stop/Resume
        -> (Done) KeyIsPressed
        -> Save {object name} current snapshot as {user input string}
        -> Set {object name} from snapshot {user input string} // IF FOUND
        -> Copy {object name} with name {user input string}

    - What's happening on an object
        -> when I hit extra information about an object it shows me 
            what things are currently affecting this object....
            e.g. Animation x, script y, 

    - (DONE) Code even more stuff
        -> transitionToState(X,code),transitionOutOfState(X,code)
           (dont on collisionmanager) onCollisionWith(X,code), 
           onAttributeChange(X,code),onAttributeRetrieval(X,code)
           onValueChange(X,code),onValueRetrieval(X,code)

    - (Depricated with Timewarp) introduce timelines
        -> a button that when clicked it will create a different "timeline" and it will show to user what will happen
           when the script is activated
        => how to prevent side-effects (e.g. object removal)
        => when is a timeline stopped? (problem when we have async calls like animations)

    - Logging system
        -> Log all actions done and show it to user in order to understand whats going on easier.

    - (Depricated) Integrated key binding feature (in settings).

    - Integrated menu system for user to END-user.
        -> pause the game
        -> change config (w/e coder use)
            -> key binding
            -> save
            -> sound
            -> etc
        -> resume game
        

Extra:
    - Starting Page includes
        -> What animation films to include
        -> Level of experience and start with different settings
        -> load saved/import projects




KNOWN BUGS:
    - (Fixed) A DOM render object position is wrong with relative position
    - When I move I check the grid but I must also move the object next to the grid
