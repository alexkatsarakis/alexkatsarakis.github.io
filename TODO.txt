EASY
    - Make blocks to interact between objects (like getObject with ID.... set text to.....)
    - Break down file blocksinstallation.js to smaller .js files
    - Change from px to move on drag.js

HARD
    implement the events each object can offer
        - onClick
        - onCollision
        - onChange
